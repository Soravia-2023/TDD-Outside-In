## Running Examples
 
To run the tests against the REST Api, you need to start the server first. 

Therefore you can just Right-Click on the EncryptedMessageApplication.java and select Run As -> Java Application.


Then the Integration Tests can be started with the port 8081

The Service Tests can be run without the need of a server.
